- Receipt Upload UI: Implement a drag-and-drop interface for single or bulk receipt uploads, supporting up to 50 receipts per session.
- Camera Capture Integration: Integrate a camera capture option for mobile users to directly upload receipts.
- Image Preview Display: Display image previews of uploaded receipts before processing.
- Client-Side File Validation: Perform client-side validation to ensure only JPG, PNG, or PDF files (max 5MB) are uploaded.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#42A5F5), inspired by financial trust and digital clarity, ensures the interface is inviting without being overbearing.
- Background color: Light gray (#ECEFF1), which maintains a professional and clean look.
- Accent color: A bright green (#66BB6A), derived analogously from blue and shifted in saturation and brightness, highlights successful transactions and confirmations.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif), providing a modern and easily readable text that suits both headers and body content, making it accessible for all users.
- Ensure a minimalistic and responsive design that adapts to both mobile and desktop screens, focusing on usability and a clutter-free interface.
- Use a set of universally recognizable icons for key functions like upload, download, and camera to simplify user navigation.
- Incorporate subtle animations on UI elements like buttons and progress bars, to provide a smoother user experience without being distracting.
